    The models used in this app were trained on a unique dataset specifically developed for detecting abusive language 
    in care environments. The dataset was compiled from various care home documentaries, capturing real-life interactions.
    The dataset consists of **566** rows of data. Each row represents a single spoken utterance from the documentaries
    , providing a diverse range of language used in care settings. The dataset includes a mixture of both abusive and 
    non-abusive language, allowing the models to learn and differentiate between different types of utterances.
